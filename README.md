## Abstract:
Travel across borders has been severely im- pacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the deployment of strict precautions to stop the virus’ cross-border spread. Pre-travel testing using reports from RT–PCR tests (polymerase chain reaction) is one such measure. However, it still needs to be determined whether or not these reports can be relied upon to identify peo- ple who require retesting before travelling. As the new variations start to emerge and spread more quickly, concerns about whether they may make the recently authorized vaccinations less effective are unavoidable. This study intends to determine how well COVID-19 RT–PCR re- ports perform in differentiating those needing a retest before travelling. By thoroughly analyz- ing data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Govt of Canada Covid sources, the study aims to offer insights that can help the Immigration unit at Toronto Pearson Interna- tional Airport identify particular travellers who are more likely to contract COVID-19 and may need special attention.


## Conclusion:
The numbers of new COVID-19 strains are emerging and coinciding with the relaxation of travel measures. The peak of the pandemic was a dire situation, and it is uncertain whether vac- cinations provided are adequate protection. Be- ing cautious is most important, as we can ob- serve from the data collected over time. Also, randomly selecting and checking the traveller is not an optimal strategy for dealing with travel protocols. With this study, we could segment international travellers according to age, sex, lo- cation and RT-PCR reports. This method facil- itates more efficient arrangements for screening travelling individuals. By leveraging the infor- mation based on demographic groups, we can identify the severity and make good decisions. At the same time, proactive measure enables us to be prepared for potential surges in COVID-19 spread and enhance our ability to provide ade- quate care and support.
